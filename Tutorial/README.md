# Midterm

## Introduction

For my project, I made a virtual Aquarium
I made it so users can relax and enjoy fish in an aquarium without actually going to the store to spend a lot of money to look at or buy an aquarium
The program is going to start by fish swimming across the screen in a coral reef environment. 


## Code Plan: Input and Output
Input
    Mouse over a fish you want to feed
    Click to drop food pellet/ellipse
Output
    Food drops on fish 
    Fish absorbs/eats the food when it is moving and close enough to the food

## Pseudocode
Variable Background 
Fish Variable 1-5
Fish move from different points
Variable Wave Counter is the speed and height of movement of certain fish 
Sin wave makes it move in an up and down motion
Variable Food mouse controls the food
Variable Release- When mouse is pressed, food is released
When food pellet goes below background, it goes back to 
When food pellet drops close to a fish, the pellet disappears

## What I Would Fix
Make fish come from other directions
Have bubbles flowing throughout aquarium
More animals besides fish like crabs and seahorse
Make more animations
Have fish interact with cursor clicks
